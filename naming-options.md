## Executive Summary

Based on competitor analysis (Hypefury, Typefully, Creator Buddy, Pallyy, SocialBee), naming best practices, and the product's unique value proposition ("Score before you post"), here are **15 name options** organized by naming strategy.

**Key insight**: Avoid "Tweet" in the name—you may expand to LinkedIn, Threads, Bluesky. "Post" or abstract names provide flexibility.

---

## Category 1: Action-Oriented (Stop/Start metaphors)

| Name | Domain Options | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **ScrollStop** | scrollstop.app, scrollstop.io | The #1 goal of a hook: make people stop scrolling. Visceral, active, memorable. Describes what good content does. |
| **Ignition** | getignition.co, ignitionhq.com | "Ignite" your content. Launch metaphor. Strong, energetic. Works for any platform. |
| **Launchpad** | launchpadpost.com, trylaunchpad.io | Every tweet needs a launchpad. Familiar metaphor (Y Combinator uses it). Implies preparation before takeoff. |

**Pros**: Evocative, active voice, easy to understand  
**Cons**: Launchpad specifically may have competition

---

## Category 2: Craftsman/Expertise (You're building something)

| Name | Domain Options | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Hooksmith** | hooksmith.co, hooksmith.io | A "smith" crafts things. You craft hooks. Artisan quality vibe. Unique, memorable, likely available. |
| **PostForge** | postforge.com, postforge.io | "Forge" = create with heat and precision. Suggests quality craftsmanship. Platform-agnostic. |
| **Punchline** | punchline.app, getpunchline.co | Your hook IS your punchline. Immediately understood. Comedy writers use this term—implies wit and timing. |

**Pros**: Implies skill and quality, differentiates from "automation" tools  
**Cons**: Might undersell the AI aspect

---

## Category 3: Intelligence/Strategy (AI-forward)

| Name | Domain Options | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **PostIQ** | postiq.co, postiq.io | "IQ" signals intelligence. Clean, professional, implies smart optimization. Two syllables, easy to say. |
| **ScoreFirst** | scorefirst.com, scorefirst.io | "Score before you post" distilled to two words. Descriptive, action-oriented. Implies a process. |
| **ReachLab** | reachlab.co, tryreachlab.com | "Lab" suggests experimentation and science. "Reach" is the goal. Professional but approachable. |

**Pros**: Communicates AI/intelligence value, professional appeal  
**Cons**: May blend with other "IQ" or "Lab" products

---

## Category 4: Platform-Aligned (X/Twitter-specific)

| Name | Domain Options | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Xcelerate** | xcelerate.app, getxcelerate.com | X + accelerate. Clever wordplay, platform-specific, growth-oriented. Modern feel. |
| **Xpand** | xpand.io, xpandreach.com | X + expand. Simple, clean, implies growth. Easy to spell and remember. |

**Pros**: Clear platform association, trendy  
**Cons**: Tied to X specifically—less flexible if you expand to LinkedIn/Threads

---

## Category 5: Emotional/Aspirational (What success feels like)

| Name | Domain Options | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **CatchFire** | catchfire.app, getcatchfire.com | Going viral = "catching fire." Hunger Games association. Energetic, memorable, implies explosive growth. |
| **Resonance** | resonance.app, getresonance.co | Content that "resonates" with audiences. Sophisticated, implies deep connection. Works across platforms. |
| **Firstline** | firstline.app, firstlineai.com | "The first line is everything." Simple truth of content creation. Clean, memorable, descriptive. |

**Pros**: Emotional connection, memorable imagery  
**Cons**: More abstract, may require explanation

## Commercialization Considerations

### Trademark Considerations

Before committing to a name:
1. Search USPTO (uspto.gov) for existing trademarks

- [ ] @name on Instagram
- [ ] /company/name on LinkedIn
- [ ] @name on Threads
