## Key Insights Summary

### Algorithm Priorities (2025)

1. **First 30 minutes are critical** - Early engagement determines distribution
2. **Premium = 4x visibility boost** - Consider the $8/month investment
3. **Links kill reach** - Non-Premium link posts get near-zero engagement
4. **Video > Image > Text** - Rich media gets algorithmic preference
5. **Timing matters** - 8-11am PST consistently outperforms

### Scoring Target

- **50+ score** = Safe to post
- **80+ score** = High probability of good reach
- **Below 40** = Rework before posting
