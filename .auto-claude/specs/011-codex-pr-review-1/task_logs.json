It references PR #1 (commit `1ca8f34ba6`) but contains no specific review suggestions or code issues to address.\n\n## Investigation Steps\n1. Examine PR #1 for actual Codex review comments with actionable feedback\n2. Check if Codex left any specific code suggestions beyond the meta-notification\n3. Determine if Issue #2 is actionable or informational\n\n## Possible Outcomes\n\n### Scenario A: No Action Needed (Most Likely)\nIf the issue is just a bot notification with no actual feedback:\n- Close Issue #2 with explanatory comment\n- Note that Codex reviews are active but no changes requested\n\n### Scenario B: Action Required\nIf PR #1 contains actual Codex feedback:\n- Document specific suggestions from Codex\n- Create follow-up tasks for each actionable item\n- Link back to specific review comments\n\n## Files to Check\n- GitHub PR #1: https://github.com/AmbitiousRealism2025/punchline-x/pull/1\n- Commit `1ca8f34ba6` for any inline review comments",

Check PR #1 for any real Codex suggestions\n2. Close Issue #2 as informational OR create follow-up tasks if needed\n\nNo code files expected to be modified - this is a GitHub issue triage task.\n\nReady for implementation.\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is an **investigation task**, not a typical code change. The spec and plan I created will guide the implementation agent to:\n\n1. **Use GitHub CLI** to examine PR #1 for actual Codex review comments\n2. **Determine** if Issue #2 requires action (unlikely) or is just bot notification (likely)\n3. **Update/close** Issue #2 appropriately with findings\n\nThe spec is intentionally minimal (under 50 lines) because this is a straightforward triage task - no codebase changes expected, just GitHub issue management.",
