Project: Punchline X - Score Explanation Cards
Workspace: 003-score-explanation-cards
Started: 2026-01-06

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Net-new feature adding educational UI layer to existing scoring system. Single-service (frontend-only), follows clear dependency order: types → component → content → integration. No backend or infrastructure changes required.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Identified 7 scoring factors: base, media, hook, engagement, timing, account, quality
- Discovered tech stack: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- Created project_index.json with frontend service configuration
- Created context.json with discovered patterns and 7 factor details
- Created implementation_plan.json with 5 phases and 13 subtasks
- Created init.sh for development environment setup
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 13

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Type Definitions & Data Structure): 1 subtask, no dependencies
- Phase 2 (ExplanationCard Component): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 1
- Phase 3 (Educational Content Creation): 7 subtasks (one per factor), depends on Phase 1
- Phase 4 (UI Integration): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 2 and Phase 3
- Phase 5 (Quality Assurance & Polish): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 4

Services Involved:
- frontend: React/TypeScript application, UI components, content display

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 2 (ExplanationCard Component) and Phase 3 (Educational Content Creation) can run in parallel
  * Both depend only on Phase 1, work on different file sets
- Speedup estimate: Minimal (~10% at best) - content creation is human authoring bottleneck

Discovery Findings:
- 7 Scoring Factors Identified:
  1. base - Fixed 40 points starting value
  2. media - Scores based on media type (image, video, gif, poll) and premium status
  3. hook - Pattern analysis (pattern interrupt, curiosity gap, contrarian, story opener, questions, numbers)
  4. engagement - CTAs, questions, emojis (1-3 good), caps (1-2 good), penalizes self-promo
  5. timing - Weekday bonus +5, 8-11am +15, 12-2pm +10, night -10
  6. account - Premium +20, Verified +10
  7. quality - Content quality evaluation

- UI Component Patterns:
  * Dialog: Radix UI primitive for modals
  * Card: Content structure component
  * Tooltip: Hover hints component
  * Button: Various variants (ghost, outline, etc.)
  * Icons: lucide-react library (InfoIcon, HelpCircle available)

- Files to Create:
  * app/src/lib/scoring/explanation-types.ts - TypeScript interfaces
  * app/src/lib/scoring/explanations.ts - Educational content data
  * app/src/components/scorer/ExplanationCard.tsx - Reusable card component

- Files to Modify:
  * app/src/components/scorer/ScoreBreakdown.tsx - Add info icon triggers

Implementation Strategy:
1. Phase 1: Create type definitions for explanation card data structure
2. Phase 2: Build reusable ExplanationCard component using Radix Dialog
3. Phase 3: Author educational content for all 7 factors (parallel with Phase 2)
4. Phase 4: Wire cards into ScoreBreakdown UI with info icon triggers
5. Phase 5: QA testing, accessibility audit, content review

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd app && npm run dev

For development environment with auto-reload:

  ./.auto-claude/specs/003-score-explanation-cards/init.sh

Or manually:

  cd app
  npm run dev
  # Open http://localhost:3000

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: low
Skip Validation: false
Test Types Required: unit
Security Scanning: not required
Staging Deployment: not required

Acceptance Criteria:
- All 7 explanation cards render without errors
- Content is accurate and matches scoring logic
- Examples are clear and educational
- Research links are valid and credible
- UI integration is seamless and accessible
- No regressions in existing scoring functionality
- Mobile and desktop viewports both work
- Keyboard navigation and screen readers work

Verification Steps:
1. Build Check: cd app && npm run build (must succeed)
2. Browser Verification: All 7 cards display correctly, keyboard accessible
3. Content Accuracy Review: Manual review against scoring logic files

=== QA ACCEPTANCE ===

Browser Verification Required:
- Scoring results page loads
- Score breakdown is expandable
- Info icons appear next to all 7 factors
- Clicking icon opens explanation card
- Card displays complete content (principle, examples, research)
- Card is mobile responsive
- Card is keyboard accessible
- No console errors

Content Verification Required:
- 7 factors covered: base, media, hook, engagement, timing, account, quality
- Each factor has algorithm principle explanation (why + how)
- Each factor has minimum 1 good example and 1 bad example
- Each factor has at least 1 research link or credible citation
- Content is educational and specific (not generic advice)
- Research links are valid (no 404s) and credible sources
- Tone is conversational but authoritative

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Next Session: Implementation Agent will execute subtasks sequentially starting with phase-1-types

=== SESSION 2 (Implementation) ===

Phase 1: Type Definitions & Data Structure
Status: COMPLETED ✓
- subtask-1-1: Created explanation-types.ts with TypeScript interfaces

Phase 2: ExplanationCard Component
Status: COMPLETED ✓
- subtask-2-1: Created ExplanationCard.tsx component with Dialog wrapper

Phase 3: Educational Content Creation
Status: IN PROGRESS (1/7 completed)

subtask-3-1: Create base score explanation content - COMPLETED ✓
Date: 2026-01-07
- Created app/src/lib/scoring/explanations.ts
- Comprehensive educational content for base score factor (40-point starting value)
- Algorithm Principle:
  * Why: Explains baseline visibility threshold and algorithm testing
  * How: Details initial distribution to 200-500 users for engagement measurement
- Examples:
  * 2 good examples: Realistic expectations for 40-point baseline, failure protection
  * 2 bad examples: Relying solely on base score, misunderstanding guaranteed reach
- Research Links (3):
  * How Social Media Algorithms Test New Content (socialmediatoday.com)
  * The Cold Start Problem in Recommendation Systems (arxiv.org)
  * Understanding Platform Visibility Thresholds (buffer.com)
- File structure includes placeholders for 6 remaining factors
- Exports: explanations map, getExplanation(), getAllExplanations()
- Verification: TypeScript compilation passes (pre-existing tinybase errors unrelated)
- Git Commits:
  * 9c36345 - Create base score explanation content
  * 61b28b5 - Update implementation plan

Next: Continue with remaining 6 content subtasks (media, hook, engagement, timing, account, quality)
