The spec acknowledges that the context gathering phase didn't identify specific files (which is expected since this is a new feature), and includes a mandatory discovery phase at the start of implementation to identify the 7 scoring factors and existing UI patterns before building.\n\nKey highlights:\n- ✅ Complete workflow type and rationale\n- ✅ Detailed functional requirements with acceptance criteria\n- ✅ Comprehensive QA testing strategy\n- ✅ Implementation strategy with 5 phases and time estimates\n- ✅ Content guidelines emphasizing educational differentiation\n- ✅ Edge cases and accessibility considerations\n\nThe implementation agent can now proceed with this specification.",

Description: A reusable component that displays educational content for scoring factors\n   132→   - Acceptance: Users can access detailed explanations for all 7 scoring factors from the results view\n   133→\n   134→2. **Algorithm Principle Education**\n   135→   - Description: Each card explains WHY the factor matters to algorithm performance, not just what it measures\n   136→   - Acceptance: Content includes clear \"why this matters\" section with algorithm mechanics\n   137→\n   138→3. **Concrete Examples**\n   139→   - Description: Each card provides contrasting good and bad examples to illustrate the principle\n   140→   - Acceptance: Minimum 2 examples per factor (1 good, 1 bad) with explanations\n   141→\n   142→4. **Research-Backed Content**\n   143→   -

Posts with built-in engagement mechanisms (questions earning +10 points, calls-to-action earning +10 points) generate 3-5x more replies and shares than passive statements, keeping users active on the platform longer. The algorithm also values authenticity: moderate emoji use (1-3 emojis, +5 points) and strategic emphasis (1-2 ALL-CAPS words, +5 points) enhance readability, while excessive use signals low-quality spam content. Most critically, the algorithm heavily penalizes self-promotional content (-15 points for phrases like \"link in bio\" or \"buy my\") because such posts prioritize the creator\\'s agenda over audience value, resulting in lower engagement rates and faster scroll-past behavior.',\n   178→      how: 'The algorithm scans your entire post text using pattern matching to calculate an engagement score (capped at 25 points maximum). First, it checks for questions: any question mark (?) adds +10 points because questions create dialogue. Second, it searches for call-to-action phrases like \"reply,\" \"comment,\" \"share,\" \"what do you think,\" \"agree?\", or \"disagree?\" - finding any one of these adds +10 points (only once, even if multiple CTAs appear). If you specifically use \"what do you think,\" you get an additional +5 bonus on top of the CTA score. Third, the algorithm counts emojis: 1-3 emojis add +5 points for personality, but 4+ emojis subtract -5 points for appearing spammy. Fourth, it counts words in ALL CAPS (3+ consecutive capital letters): 1-2 caps words add +5 points for emphasis, but 3+ caps words subtract -10 points for seeming aggressive. Finally, it checks for self-promotional patterns like \"check out my,\" \"buy my,\" \"link in bio,\" \"follow me,\" \"use my code,\" or discount offers - any single match subtracts -15 points.

Posts with built-in engagement mechanisms (questions earning +10 points, calls-to-action earning +10 points) generate 3-5x more replies and shares than passive statements, keeping users active on the platform longer. The algorithm also values authenticity: moderate emoji use (1-3 emojis, +5 points) and strategic emphasis (1-2 ALL-CAPS words, +5 points) enhance readability, while excessive use signals low-quality spam content. Most critically, the algorithm heavily penalizes self-promotional content (-15 points for phrases like \"link in bio\" or \"buy my\") because such posts prioritize the creator\\'s agenda over audience value, resulting in lower engagement rates and faster scroll-past behavior.',\n   178→      how: 'The algorithm scans your entire post text using pattern matching to calculate an engagement score (capped at 25 points maximum). First, it checks for questions: any question mark (?) adds +10 points because questions create dialogue. Second, it searches for call-to-action phrases like \"reply,\" \"comment,\" \"share,\" \"what do you think,\" \"agree?\", or \"disagree?\" - finding any one of these adds +10 points (only once, even if multiple CTAs appear). If you specifically use \"what do you think,\" you get an additional +5 bonus on top of the CTA score. Third, the algorithm counts emojis: 1-3 emojis add +5 points for personality, but 4+ emojis subtract -5 points for appearing spammy. Fourth, it counts words in ALL CAPS (3+ consecutive capital letters): 1-2 caps words add +5 points for emphasis, but 3+ caps words subtract -10 points for seeming aggressive. Finally, it checks for self-promotional patterns like \"check out my,\" \"buy my,\" \"link in bio,\" \"follow me,\" \"use my code,\" or discount offers - any single match subtracts -15 points.

Strategic hashtag use (1-3 hashtags, +5 points) aids discoverability without appearing spammy, while hashtag stuffing (4+, -10 points) signals low-quality content optimization. These quality signals help the algorithm distinguish between thoughtful contributions and rushed, low-effort posts.',\n   385→      how: 'The algorithm analyzes your complete post text through multiple quality checks, with scores ranging from -20 to +25 points. First, it counts total characters: posts between 100-200 characters earn +10 points for hitting the \"sweet spot\" of substantive but scannable content, posts under 50 characters lose -5 points for appearing too brief or low-effort (unless they\\'re intentional short-form content), and posts over 250 characters lose -5 points for being too dense for typical scrolling behavior. Second, it searches for thread indicators using pattern matching: if your text contains the thread emoji (🧵) or the word \"thread:\" (case-insensitive), you earn +5 points because this signals a multi-part content series that increases platform engagement. Third, it checks for structured formatting at the start of lines: if any line begins with a number followed by a space (like \"1. First point\"), a bullet character (•), or a dash/hyphen (- or —), you earn +5 points for enhanced readability. Fourth, it counts hashtags by matching the # symbol followed by word characters: exactly 1-3 hashtags earns +5 points for balanced discoverability, while 4 or more hashtags triggers a -10 penalty for appearing spammy or keyword-stuffed.

Here's what was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Subtask Completed: Add Info Icon Triggers to ScoreBreakdown\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Added imports:**\n   - `Dialog` and `DialogTrigger` from the UI dialog component\n   - `InfoIcon` from lucide-react\n   - `ExplanationCard` component\n   - `getExplanation` function and `FactorId` type\n\n2. **Updated ScoreBreakdown component:**\n   - Wrapped each of the 7 scoring factors (base, media, hook, engagement, timing, account, quality) in a `Dialog` component\n   - Added an info icon button next to each factor label\n   - Connected each icon to open a dialog with the `ExplanationCard` displaying detailed information about that scoring factor\n\n3. **Ensured accessibility:**\n   - Info icon buttons include `aria-label` attributes describing what they do\n   - Buttons have proper focus states with focus rings (`focus:ring-2`)\n   - Keyboard navigation works correctly (can tab to icons and press Enter/Space to open dialogs)\n\n4. **Committed changes:**\n   - Created a clean commit with descriptive message following the project conventions\n\n### Verification Checklist:\n- ✅ Info icons appear next to each of 7 scoring factors\n- ✅ Icons are keyboard accessible (focus rings, aria-labels, keyboard triggers)\n- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors\n- ✅ Follows patterns from reference files (Dialog, Radix UI components)\n- ✅ Clean commit created\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready for testing in the browser at http://localhost:3000. The info icons will appear when you expand the Score Breakdown card, and clicking any icon will open a detailed explanation dialog for that scoring factor.",

Cards must work on mobile devices where scoring is viewed\n   159→4. **Loading State** - If content is fetched async, provide loading indicators\n   160→5. **Accessibility** - Card triggers (buttons/icons) must be keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly\n   161→\n   162→## Implementation Notes\n   163→\n   164→### Phase 1: Discovery (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)\n   165→\n   166→Before building, identify:\n   167→- [ ] The 7 scoring factors (names, IDs, current display location)\n   168→- [ ] Existing component patterns for cards/modals/tooltips\n   169→- [ ] Where scoring results are rendered in the UI\n   170→- [ ] Styling system and design tokens\n   171→- [ ] Content management approach (static files vs. CMS vs. hardcoded)\n   172→\n   173→### Phase 2: Component Design\n   174→\n   175→**DO:**\n   176→- Create a reusable `ExplanationCard` component that works for all 7 factors\n   177→- Follow existing design system (colors, typography, spacing)\n   178→- Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels for accessibility\n   179→- Make the trigger mechanism discoverable but unobtrusive (info icon, \"Learn more\" link)\n   180→- Structure content with clear headings: \"Why It Matters\", \"Good Examples\", \"Bad Examples\", \"Learn More\"\n   181→\n   182→**DON'T:**\n   183→- Create 7 separate hardcoded card components (use data-driven approach)\n   184→- Block the user's workflow with forced modals\n   185→- Use generic language like \"This is important\" - be specific about algorithm mechanics\n   186→- Skip research links - credibility is key to differentiation\n   187→- Ignore mobile/responsive design\n   188→\n   189→### Phase 3: Content Creation\n   190→\n   191→**Content Guidelines:**\n   192→- **Algorithm Principle**: Explain in plain language how the algorithm evaluates this factor and why it correlates with virality/engagement\n   193→- **Good Examples**: Show real or realistic examples that score well, with annotations explaining why\n   194→- **Bad Examples**: Show contrast examples that score poorly, with explanations of what's wrong\n   195→- **Research**: Link to TikTok Creator resources, social media studies, or behavioral psychology research\n   196→\n   197→**Tone**: Educational but conversational, expert but accessible\n   198→\n   199→### Phase 4: Integration\n   200→\n   201→**DO:**\n   202→- Add subtle info icons or \"?\" buttons next to each factor score\n   203→- Use modals or slide-out panels for card display (depending on existing patterns)\n   204→- Ensure cards can be dismissed easily (X button, outside click, ESC key)\n   205→- Test on actual scoring results page with real data\n   206→\n   207→**DON'T:**\n   208→- Hide the cards in hard-to-find settings pages\n   209→- Auto-open cards on every page load (user-initiated only)\n   210→- Break existing score display layout\n   211→\n   212→## Development Environment\n   213→\n   214→### Start Services\n   215→\n   216→```bash\n   217→# Install dependencies (if needed)\n   218→npm install\n   219→\n   220→# Start development server\n   221→npm run dev\n   222→```\n   223→\n  \n\n...
