The spec acknowledges that the context gathering phase didn't identify specific files (which is expected since this is a new feature), and includes a mandatory discovery phase at the start of implementation to identify the 7 scoring factors and existing UI patterns before building.\n\nKey highlights:\n- ✅ Complete workflow type and rationale\n- ✅ Detailed functional requirements with acceptance criteria\n- ✅ Comprehensive QA testing strategy\n- ✅ Implementation strategy with 5 phases and time estimates\n- ✅ Content guidelines emphasizing educational differentiation\n- ✅ Edge cases and accessibility considerations\n\nThe implementation agent can now proceed with this specification.",

The goal is to transform the tool from a diagnostic system into a learning platform that teaches creators WHY certain content factors matter for algorithm performance.

Description: A reusable component that displays educational content for scoring factors\n   132→   - Acceptance: Users can access detailed explanations for all 7 scoring factors from the results view\n   133→\n   134→2. **Algorithm Principle Education**\n   135→   - Description: Each card explains WHY the factor matters to algorithm performance, not just what it measures\n   136→   - Acceptance: Content includes clear \"why this matters\" section with algorithm mechanics\n   137→\n   138→3. **Concrete Examples**\n   139→   - Description: Each card provides contrasting good and bad examples to illustrate the principle\n   140→   - Acceptance: Minimum 2 examples per factor (1 good, 1 bad) with explanations\n   141→\n   142→4. **Research-Backed Content**\n   143→   -

be specific about algorithm mechanics\n   186→- Skip research links - credibility is key to differentiation\n   187→- Ignore mobile/responsive design\n   188→\n   189→### Phase 3: Content Creation\n   190→\n   191→**Content Guidelines:**\n   192→- **Algorithm Principle**: Explain in plain language how the algorithm evaluates this factor and why it correlates with virality/engagement\n   193→- **Good Examples**: Show real or realistic examples that score well, with annotations explaining why\n   194→- **Bad Examples**: Show contrast examples that score poorly, with explanations of what's wrong\n   195→- **Research**: Link to TikTok Creator resources, social media studies, or behavioral psychology research\n   196→\n   197→**Tone**: Educational but conversational, expert but accessible\n   198→\n   199→### Phase 4: Integration\n   200→\n   201→**DO:**\n   202→- Add subtle info icons or \"?\" buttons next to each factor score\n   203→- Use modals or slide-out panels for card display (depending on existing patterns)\n   204→- Ensure cards can be dismissed easily (X button, outside click, ESC key)\n   205→- Test on actual scoring results page with real data\n   206→\n   207→**DON'T:**\n   208→- Hide the cards in hard-to-find settings pages\n   209→- Auto-open cards on every page load (user-initiated only)\n   210→- Break existing score display layout\n   211→\n   212→## Development Environment\n   213→\n   214→### Start Services\n   215→\n   216→```bash\n   217→# Install dependencies (if needed)\n   218→npm install\n   219→\n   220→# Start development server\n   221→npm run dev\n   222→```\n   223→\n  \n\n...

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Created File\n- **`app/src/lib/scoring/explanation-types.ts`** - Complete TypeScript interface definitions\n\n### Types Defined\n1. **`AlgorithmPrinciple`** - Contains `why` and `how` fields for explaining algorithm mechanics\n2. **`Example`** - Structure for individual examples with `description` and `example` fields\n3. **`ExampleSet`** - Organized good/bad example arrays\n4. **`ResearchLink`** - Research citations with `title`, `url`, and `summary`\n5. **`ScoringFactorExplanation`** - Main interface combining all elements\n6. **`FactorId`** - Union type for the 7 scoring factors: `'base' | 'media' | 'hook' | 'engagement' | 'timing' | 'account' | 'quality'`\n7. **`ExplanationsMap`** - Record type for looking up explanations by factor ID\n\n### Pattern Adherence\n- Followed the existing code style from `app/src/lib/scoring/types.ts`\n- Used consistent naming conventions\n- Applied proper TypeScript interface structure\n\n### Commits\n- ✅ Created and committed the new types file\n- ✅ Updated implementation_plan.json to mark subtask as completed\n\n### Note on Build Verification\nThe project has pre-existing dependency issues with `tinybase` (not installed via npm/bun). This is unrelated to the new file I created. The `explanation-types.ts` file itself is syntactically valid TypeScript with no errors and introduces no new dependencies.\n\nThe subtask is complete and ready for the next phase!",

The goal is to transform the tool from a diagnostic system into a learning platform that teaches creators WHY certain content factors matter for algorithm performance.

Description: Each card explains WHY the factor matters to algorithm performance, not just what it measures\n   136→   - Acceptance: Content includes clear \"why this matters\" section with algorithm mechanics\n   137→\n   138→3. **Concrete Examples**\n   139→   -

The goal is to transform the tool from a diagnostic system into a learning platform that teaches creators WHY certain content factors matter for algorithm performance. This addresses a critical market gap where competing tools (like Creator Buddy) provide generic suggestions without educational context, positioning Punchline X as the tool that improves creator skills over time.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a net-new feature adding educational content infrastructure to the existing scoring system.

Description: A reusable component that displays educational content for scoring factors\n   132→   - Acceptance: Users can access detailed explanations for all 7 scoring factors from the results view\n   133→\n   134→2. **Algorithm Principle Education**\n   135→   - Description: Each card explains WHY the factor matters to algorithm performance, not just what it measures\n   136→   - Acceptance: Content includes clear \"why this matters\" section with algorithm mechanics\n   137→\n   138→3. **Concrete Examples**\n   139→   - Description: Each card provides contrasting good and bad examples to illustrate the principle\n   140→   - Acceptance: Minimum 2 examples per factor (1 good, 1 bad) with explanations\n   141→\n   142→4. **Research-Backed Content**\n   143→   -
