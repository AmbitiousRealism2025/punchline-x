Extend existing ai-proxy.ts with voice-aware system prompts\n2. Add voiceProfile & exampleTweets tables to TinyBase store\n3. Install string-similarity-js for voice match scoring baseline\n4. Use GPT-4o/GPT-5.1+ for best persona/tone steerability\n5. Implement hybrid scoring: client-side quick metrics + occasional AI validation\n6. Cache voice-adapted prompts to reduce API costs\n7. Skip NLP libraries unless need offline analysis\n\n=== ARCHITECTURE NOTES ===\n\nCurrent Stack: React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript + TinyBase + Bun\nAI Integration: OpenAI SDK via Bun proxy (port 3001)\nState: TinyBase with localStorage auto-persistence\nNo Backend: All data stored in browser localStorage\n\nImplementation Complexity:\n- Storage: LOW (TinyBase ready, just add tables)\n- AI Integration: MEDIUM (extend existing proxy)\n- Voice Matching: MEDIUM (design scoring algorithm)\n- UI Components: MEDIUM (use existing Radix UI)\n\nresearch.json created successfully.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Research Sources\n\n**OpenAI Documentation:**\n- [Chat Completions API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)\n- [openai-node GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openai/openai-node)\n- [openai on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)\n- [GPT-5.1 Prompting Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5-1_prompting_guide)\n- [Prompt Engineering Best Practices](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)\n\n**TinyBase Documentation:**\n- [TinyBase Official Site](https://tinybase.org/)\n- [Persisters API](https://tinybase.org/api/persisters/)\n- [Persistence Guide](https://tinybase.org/guides/persistence/an-intro-to-persistence/)\n- [tinybase on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinybase)\n\n**String Similarity:**\n- [string-similarity-js on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity-js)\n- [string-similarity (deprecated)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity)\n- [NPM Comparison: Similarity Libraries](https://npm-compare.com/similarity,string-similarity)\n- [string-comparison on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-comparison)\n\n**NLP Resources:**\n- [compromise on GitHub](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise)\n- [wink-nlp Official Docs](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/)\n- [NLP in Node.js - LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/natural-language-processing-node-js/)\n- [NPM Comparison: NLP Libraries](https://npm-compare.com/compromise,natural,wink-nlp)",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n

137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Client-side API call\n   152→export async function generateHooks(topic: string): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   153→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   154→    method: 'POST',\n   155→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json'

Message Pattern Correction (MEDIUM)**\n- **Issue**: AI pattern showed embedding system prompt in user message instead of using proper `system` role\n- **Fix**: Added both current legacy pattern AND recommended voice-aware pattern with proper multi-message structure (system → few-shot → user)\n- **Impact**: Developers will now implement voice profiles using OpenAI best practices\n\n**2. Missing Implementation Details (MEDIUM)**  \n- **Issue**: Helper functions referenced but not implemented\n- **Fix**: Added complete TypeScript implementations for `buildVoiceSystemPrompt()` and `buildFewShotMessages()` with proper type signatures\n- **Impact**: Clear guidance on how to construct voice-aware prompts\n\n**3. Interface Definitions (LOW)**\n- **Issue**: VoiceProfile and ExampleTweet interfaces mentioned but not defined\n- **Fix**: Added complete interface definitions with all fields and types\n- **Impact**: Type-safe implementation with clear data structure\n\n**4. Import Statement (LOW)**\n- **Issue**: OpenAI import not shown in pattern\n- **Fix**: Added `import OpenAI from 'openai'` at pattern beginning\n- **Impact**: Complete, copy-pasteable code examples\n\n**5. Temperature Consistency (LOW)**\n- **Issue**: Temperature varied between sections (0.7, 0.7-0.9, unspecified)\n- **Fix**: Standardized on 0.8 as primary recommendation throughout\n- **Impact**: Consistent configuration across all sections\n\n### Verification Complete\n\n✅ **Technical Accuracy**: All package names correct, APIs match research, patterns follow best practices  \n✅ **Completeness**: All requirements covered, edge cases handled, interfaces defined  \n✅ **Consistency**: Terminology, file paths, and patterns consistent throughout  \n✅ **Feasibility**: Implementation is realistic and well-scoped  \n✅ **Research Alignment**: Matches all verified findings from research.json  \n\n### Files Updated\n\n- ✅ `spec.md` - All issues fixed, ready for implementation\n- ✅ `critique_report.json` - Created with detailed findings\n\nThe spec is now **ready for the implementation phase** with high confidence that it will result in correct, maintainable code following best practices.",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n   154→// Client-side API call (app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts)\n   155→export async function generateHooks(topic: string, voiceProfile?: VoiceProfile): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   156→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   157→    method: 'POST',\n   158→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   159→    body: JSON.stringify({ topic, voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user message\n   172→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-hooks') {\n   173→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   174→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   175→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   176→    temperature: 0.7,\n   177→    messages: [{\n   178→      role: 'user',\n   179→      content: `${HOOK_PROMPT}\\n\\nTopic: \"${topic}\"`,\n   180→    }],\n   181→  })\n   182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for: ${topic}` },\n   198→    ],\n   199→  })\n   200→\n   201→  const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content\n   202→  return new Response(content, {\n   203→    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n   222→import { useCell, useSetCellCallback } from 'tinybase/ui-react'\n   223→\n   224→export function Component() {\n   225→  const currentText = (useCell('currentTweet', 'draft', 'text') as string) ?? ''\n   226→\n   227→  const setText = useSetCellCallback(\n   228→    'currentTweet',\n   229→    'draft',\n   230→    'text',\n   231→    (newText: string) => newText,\n   232→    []\n   233→  )\n   234→\n   235→  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\n   236→  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n   237→\n   238→  // Use loading/error states for async operations\n   239→  // Use TinyBase hooks for store integration\n \n\n...

Here's what was implemented:\n\n## ✅ Completed: Voice Profile Schema and Interfaces\n\n**Changes made to `app/src/lib/store/index.ts`:**\n\n1. **Extended TweetLogEntry interface:**\n   - Added `voiceMatchScore?: number` field for tracking voice match quality\n\n2. **Added VoiceProfile interface:**\n   - `tone`: 1-5 scale (1=very formal, 5=very casual)\n   - `formality`: 'formal' | 'neutral' | 'casual'\n   - `humorLevel`: 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'\n   - `emojiUsage`: 'never' | 'rarely' | 'often' | 'always'\n   - `topicPreferences`: optional string array\n\n3. **Added ExampleTweet interface:**\n   - `id`: unique identifier\n   - `text`: tweet content\n   - `addedAt`: timestamp\n\n4. **Initialized default voice profile:**\n   - Set neutral defaults in TinyBase store\n\n5. **Implemented CRUD functions:**\n   - `setVoiceProfile(profile)`: Save voice profile\n   - `getVoiceProfile()`: Retrieve voice profile\n   - `addExampleTweet(text)`: Add example tweet\n   - `getExampleTweets()`: Get all example tweets\n   - `deleteExampleTweet(id)`: Remove example tweet\n\n6. **Updated getTweetHistory():**\n   - Now includes voiceMatchScore in returned data\n\nAll changes follow the existing TinyBase patterns and will auto-persist to localStorage. The implementation is ready for the next phase (Settings UI).",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n

182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method ===

'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n## ✅ Subtask Completed: Create VoiceProfileForm Component\n\n### What Was Built\n\nCreated `app/src/components/settings/VoiceProfileForm.tsx` with the following features:\n\n**Voice Profile Configuration:**\n- **Tone Slider**: 1-5 scale (Very Formal → Very Casual) with live label display\n- **Formality Toggle**: Three options (Formal, Neutral, Casual)\n- **Humor Level Toggle**: Four options (None, Low, Medium, High)\n- **Emoji Usage Toggle**: Four options (Never, Rarely, Often, Always)\n- **Topic Preferences**: Comma-separated input field for topic tags\n\n**Example Tweets Section:**\n- Add up to 3 example tweets to teach AI your writing style\n- Display existing examples with hover-to-reveal remove buttons\n- Textarea input for new examples with character validation\n- Auto-persists to TinyBase store\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n✅ **Follows Established Patterns:**\n- Used TinyBase hooks (`useCell`, `useSetCellCallback`) for reactive state management\n- Component structure mirrors `MediaToggles.tsx` for settings controls\n- Card layout with `raycast-shine` styling matches existing UI\n- Error-free TypeScript compilation\n\n✅ **Auto-Save Behavior:**\n- All settings automatically persist to localStorage via TinyBase\n- Changes are instant - no save button needed\n- State syncs across component lifecycle\n\n✅ **Verification Passed:**\n- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors\n- Git commit: ✅ Committed successfully\n- Implementation plan: ✅ Updated to completed status\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThe component is ready to be integrated into the Settings tab in App.tsx (subtask-2-3).",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

`app/src/lib/store/index.ts` | Frontend | Add `voiceProfile` and `exampleTweets` tables, create voice profile CRUD functions |\n    84→| `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts` | AI Proxy | Add voice profile injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score

follow:\n    93→\n    94→| File | Pattern to Copy |\n    95→|------|----------------|\n    96→| `app/src/lib/store/index.ts` | TinyBase table schema, row setting, auto-persistence pattern |\n    97→| `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx` | AI feature component structure, loading states, error handling |\n    98→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | API call pattern to AI proxy server |\n    99→|

|\n   101→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Tab structure and navigation |\n   102→\n   103→## Patterns to Follow\n   104→\n   105→### TinyBase Store Pattern\n   106→\n   107→From `app/src/lib/store/index.ts`:\n   108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n

voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user

182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for:

'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n

ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n   154→// Client-side API call (app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts)\n   155→export async function generateHooks(topic: string, voiceProfile?: VoiceProfile): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   156→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   157→    method: 'POST',\n   158→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   159→    body: JSON.stringify({ topic, voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user message\n   172→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-hooks') {\n   173→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   174→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   175→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   176→    temperature: 0.7,\n   177→    messages: [{\n   178→      role: 'user',\n   179→      content: `${HOOK_PROMPT}\\n\\nTopic: \"${topic}\"`,\n   180→    }],\n   181→  })\n   182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for: ${topic}` },\n   198→    ],\n   199→  })\n   200→\n   201→  const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content\n   202→  return new Response(content, {\n   203→    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n   222→import { useCell, useSetCellCallback } from 'tinybase/ui-react'\n   223→\n   224→export function Component() {\n   225→  const currentText = (useCell('currentTweet', 'draft', 'text') as string) ??

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n   154→// Client-side API call (app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts)\n   155→export async function generateHooks(topic: string, voiceProfile?: VoiceProfile): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   156→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   157→    method: 'POST',\n   158→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   159→    body: JSON.stringify({ topic, voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user message\n   172→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-hooks') {\n   173→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   174→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   175→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   176→    temperature: 0.7,\n   177→    messages: [{\n   178→      role: 'user',\n   179→      content: `${HOOK_PROMPT}\\n\\nTopic: \"${topic}\"`,\n   180→    }],\n   181→  })\n   182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for: ${topic}` },\n   198→    ],\n   199→  })\n   200→\n   201→  const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content\n   202→  return new Response(content, {\n   203→    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n   222→import { useCell, useSetCellCallback } from 'tinybase/ui-react'\n   223→\n   224→export function Component() {\n   225→  const currentText = (useCell('currentTweet', 'draft', 'text') as string) ?? ''\n   226→\n   227→  const setText = useSetCellCallback(\n   228→    'currentTweet',\n   229→    'draft',\n   230→    'text',\n   231→    (newText: string) => newText,\n   232→    []\n   233→  )\n   234→\n   235→  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\n   236→  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n   237→\n   238→  // Use loading/error states for async operations\n   239→  // Use TinyBase hooks for store integration\n \n\n...

Here's what was done:\n\n**Changes Made:**\n- Modified `TweetInput.tsx` to include `voiceMatchScore: score` when calling `logTweet()`\n- This ensures voice match scores are stored alongside the regular score in tweet log entries\n\n**Verification:**\nThe implementation follows the existing pattern where the `TweetLogEntry` interface already had the optional `voiceMatchScore?: number` field defined. Now when users generate a hook and copy a tweet, the localStorage 'tweet-optimizer' → tweetLog entries will contain the voiceMatchScore field.\n\n**Committed:**\n- Changes committed with message: \"auto-claude: subtask-4-4 - Store voice match scores in tweet log\"\n- Subtask status updated to \"completed\" in implementation_plan.json\n\nReady for the next subtask or task!",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

`app/src/lib/store/index.ts` | Frontend | Add `voiceProfile` and `exampleTweets` tables, create voice profile CRUD functions |\n    84→| `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts` | AI Proxy | Add voice profile injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n

'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice

 108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n   154→// Client-side API call (app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts)\n   155→export async function generateHooks(topic: string, voiceProfile?: VoiceProfile): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   156→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   157→    method: 'POST',\n   158→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   159→    body: JSON.stringify({ topic, voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user message\n   172→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-hooks') {\n   173→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   174→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   175→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   176→    temperature: 0.7,\n   177→    messages: [{\n   178→      role: 'user',\n   179→      content: `${HOOK_PROMPT}\\n\\nTopic: \"${topic}\"`,\n   180→    }],\n   181→  })\n   182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for: ${topic}` },\n   198→    ],\n   199→  })\n   200→\n   201→  const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content\n   202→  return new Response(content, {\n   203→    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n   222→import { useCell, useSetCellCallback } from 'tinybase/ui-react'\n   223→\n   224→export function Component() {\n   225→  const currentText = (useCell('currentTweet', 'draft', 'text') as string) ?? ''\n   226→\n   227→  const setText = useSetCellCallback(\n   228→    'currentTweet',\n   229→    'draft',\n   230→    'text',\n   231→    (newText: string) => newText,\n   232→    []\n   233→  )\n   234→\n   235→  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\n   236→  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n   237→\n   238→  // Use loading/error states for async operations\n   239→  // Use TinyBase hooks for store integration\n \n\n...

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

`app/src/lib/store/index.ts` | Frontend | Add `voiceProfile` and `exampleTweets` tables, create voice profile CRUD functions |\n    84→| `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts` | AI Proxy | Add voice profile injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score alongside existing score |\n    88→| `app/package.json` | Frontend | Add `string-similarity-js` dependency |\n    89→\n    90→## Files to Reference\n    91→\n    92→These files show patterns to follow:\n    93→\n    94→| File | Pattern to Copy |\n    95→|------|----------------|\n    96→| `app/src/lib/store/index.ts` | TinyBase table schema, row setting, auto-persistence pattern |\n    97→| `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx` | AI feature component structure, loading states, error handling |\n    98→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | API call pattern to AI proxy server |\n    99→| `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts` | OpenAI SDK usage, prompt engineering, CORS handling, endpoint creation |\n   100→| `app/src/components/scorer/MediaToggles.tsx` | Radix UI toggle pattern for settings |\n   101→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Tab structure and navigation |\n   102→\n   103→## Patterns to Follow\n   104→\n   105→### TinyBase Store Pattern\n   106→\n   107→From `app/src/lib/store/index.ts`:\n   108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n   154→// Client-side API call (app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts)\n   155→export async function generateHooks(topic: string, voiceProfile?: VoiceProfile): Promise<GeneratedHook[]> {\n   156→  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/generate-hooks', {\n   157→    method: 'POST',\n   158→    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   159→    body: JSON.stringify({ topic, voiceProfile }),\n   160→  })\n   161→\n   162→  if (!response.ok) {\n   163→    const error = await response.json()\n   164→    throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate hooks')\n   165→  }\n   166→\n   167→  return await response.json()\n   168→}\n   169→\n   170→// Server-side endpoint (CURRENT pattern for existing hooks)\n   171→// NOTE: Existing implementation embeds prompt in user message\n   172→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-hooks') {\n   173→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   174→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   175→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   176→    temperature: 0.7,\n   177→    messages: [{\n   178→      role: 'user',\n   179→      content: `${HOOK_PROMPT}\\n\\nTopic: \"${topic}\"`,\n   180→    }],\n   181→  })\n   182→}\n   183→\n   184→// Server-side endpoint (RECOMMENDED pattern for voice-aware generation)\n   185→// Use separate system message for voice persona + few-shot examples\n   186→if (req.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/generate-voice-aware') {\n   187→  const systemMessage = buildVoiceSystemPrompt(voiceProfile)\n   188→  const exampleMessages = buildFewShotMessages(exampleTweets)\n   189→\n   190→  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({\n   191→    model: ZAI_MODEL,\n   192→    max_tokens: 2048,\n   193→    temperature: 0.8, // Higher for natural variation\n   194→    messages: [\n   195→      { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },\n   196→      ...exampleMessages, // Few-shot learning\n   197→      { role: 'user', content: `Generate hooks for: ${topic}` },\n   198→    ],\n   199→  })\n   200→\n   201→  const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content\n   202→  return new Response(content, {\n   203→    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n   204→  })\n   205→}\n   206→```\n   207→\n   208→**Key Points:**\n   209→- Client calls `localhost:3001/api/*` endpoints\n   210→- Server uses OpenAI SDK with ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n   222→import { useCell, useSetCellCallback } from 'tinybase/ui-react'\n   223→\n   224→export function Component() {\n   225→  const currentText = (useCell('currentTweet', 'draft', 'text') as string) ?? ''\n   226→\n   227→  const setText = useSetCellCallback(\n   228→    'currentTweet',\n   229→    'draft',\n   230→    'text',\n   231→    (newText: string) => newText,\n   232→    []\n   233→  )\n   234→\n   235→  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\n   236→  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n   237→\n   238→  // Use loading/error states for async operations\n   239→  // Use TinyBase hooks for store integration\n \n\n...

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice profile per user for MVP)\n    34→- Voice profile export/import functionality\n    35→\n    36→## Service Context\n    37→\n    38→### Frontend Application\n    39→\n    40→**Tech Stack:**\n    41→-

injection to prompts, implement few-shot learning, add voice-aware generation endpoint |\n    85→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Frontend | Add \"Settings\" tab to existing Tabs component |\n    86→| `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` | Frontend | Extend to support voice profile parameters, add voice match scoring |\n    87→| `app/src/components/scorer/TweetInput.tsx` | Frontend | Display voice match score

|\n   101→| `app/src/App.tsx` | Tab structure and navigation |\n   102→\n   103→## Patterns to Follow\n   104→\n   105→### TinyBase Store Pattern\n   106→\n   107→From `app/src/lib/store/index.ts`:\n   108→\n   109→```typescript\n   110→// Define table schema by setting initial row\n   111→store.setRow('settings', 'user', {\n   112→  isPremium: false,\n   113→  isVerified: false,\n   114→  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles',\n   115→})\n   116→\n   117→// Create typed interfaces for data\n   118→export interface TweetLogEntry {\n   119→  text: string\n   120→  score: number\n   121→  // ... other fields\n   122→}\n   123→\n   124→// Create helper functions for CRUD\n   125→export function logTweet(entry: Omit<TweetLogEntry, 'copiedAt'>): string {\n   126→  const id = `tweet_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8)}`\n   127→  store.setRow('tweetLog', id, {\n   128→    ...entry,\n   129→    copiedAt: Date.now(),\n   130→  })\n   131→  return id\n   132→}\n   133→\n   134→// Auto-persistence is already configured\n   135→const persister = createLocalPersister(store, 'tweet-optimizer')\n   136→persister.startAutoSave()\n   137→persister.startAutoLoad()\n   138→```\n   139→\n   140→**Key Points:**\n   141→- TinyBase auto-saves to localStorage on every change\n   142→- Use `store.setRow(table, id, data)` pattern for all writes\n   143→- Create TypeScript interfaces matching table schemas\n   144→- Helper functions provide type-safe abstractions\n   145→\n   146→### AI API Integration Pattern\n   147→\n   148→From `app/src/lib/ai/hooks.ts` and `app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts`:\n   149→\n   150→```typescript\n   151→// Server-side imports (app/src/server/ai-proxy.ts)\n   152→import OpenAI from 'openai'\n   153→\n

ZAI base URL\n   211→- **IMPORTANT**: Use `system` role messages for voice persona (better AI steering)\n   212→- Include few-shot examples as separate assistant/user message pairs\n   213→- Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use multi-message structure (best practice)\n   216→\n   217→### React Component with TinyBase Hooks\n   218→\n   219→From `app/src/components/ai/HookGenerator.tsx`:\n   220→\n   221→```typescript\n

Add dependency to package.json\n2. Run `cd app && npm install`\n3. Run `npm run build` → Should complete with 0 errors\n4. Commit: `fix: add missing tinybase dependency (qa-requested)`\n\n**Estimated fix time**: 5 minutes\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Coder Agent**: Add TinyBase dependency to package.json\n2. **Coder Agent**: Install and verify build succeeds\n3. **Coder Agent**: Commit the fix\n4. **QA Agent**: Re-run validation (should APPROVE after fix)\n\n---\n\n**Note**: I have attempted to update `implementation_plan.json` with the qa_signoff status but am awaiting write permissions. The QA sign-off data that needs to be written is:\n\n```json\n\"qa_signoff\": {\n  \"status\": \"rejected\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-07T05:15:00.000Z\",\n  \"qa_session\": 2,\n  \"issues_found\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"critical\",\n      \"title\": \"Missing TinyBase dependency in package.json\",\n      \"location\": \"app/package.json\",\n      \"fix_required\": \"Add 'tinybase': '^7.3.1' to dependencies object and run npm install\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"fix_request_file\": \"QA_FIX_REQUEST.md\"\n}\n```\n\nThis should replace the current `\"qa_signoff\": null` on line 570 of `implementation_plan.json`.",

This addresses a major competitor pain point where AI suggestions require heavy manual editing to match personal tone. Users configure voice preferences (formal/casual, humor level, emoji usage, topic preferences) and provide example tweets representing their authentic voice. The AI system uses this profile to generate suggestions that feel authentic and brand-consistent, with a voice match score indicating quality.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This introduces new capability for voice-aware AI content generation. It requires new data models (voice profiles, example tweets), new UI components (settings interface), enhanced AI generation logic, and a voice matching system. This is not a refactor or bug fix but a significant feature addition that changes how users interact with AI suggestions.\n    12→\n    13→## Task Scope\n    14→\n    15→### Services Involved\n    16→- **Frontend (React/Vite)** (primary) - Voice profile UI, voice match score display, settings management\n    17→- **AI Proxy Server (Bun)** (integration) - Enhanced prompt generation with voice parameters, few-shot learning integration\n    18→- **TinyBase Store** (data layer) - Voice profile persistence, example tweet storage\n    19→\n    20→### This Task Will:\n    21→- [ ] Create voice profile data schema in TinyBase (tone, formality, humor, emoji, topics)\n    22→- [ ] Build Settings tab UI for voice profile configuration\n    23→- [ ] Implement example tweet input mechanism (2-3 samples)\n    24→- [ ] Enhance AI proxy to inject voice parameters into system prompts\n    25→- [ ] Implement few-shot learning using example tweets\n    26→- [ ] Create voice match scoring algorithm (text similarity + style metrics)\n    27→- [ ] Display voice match score for AI-generated content\n    28→- [ ] Store match scores in tweetLog for analytics\n    29→\n    30→### Out of Scope:\n    31→- Advanced NLP libraries (compromise/natural) - using AI-based approach instead\n    32→- Migration from ZAI API to OpenAI (can be done later if needed)\n    33→- Multi-persona support (one voice

Temperature 0.7-0.9 for natural variation (0.8 recommended for voice matching)\n   214→- Current hook generation uses single user message (legacy pattern)\n   215→- Voice-aware generation should use

Go to http://localhost:5198 (or whatever port)\n# 2. Navigate to Settings tab\n# 3. Configure voice profile\n# 4. Add example tweets\n# 5. Generate hooks and verify voice match scores\n```\n\n---\n\n## VERDICT\n\n**SIGN-OFF**: ✅ **APPROVED**\n\n**Reason**: \n- All code integration complete and correct\n- TypeScript compilation successful\n- Security review passed\n- Pattern compliance verified\n- No regressions in existing functionality\n- Database schema properly implemented\n- Minor issues are non-blocking and acceptable for MVP\n\n**What This Approval Means**:\n- Code quality: Production-ready\n- Integration: Complete\n- Security: No vulnerabilities\n- Patterns: Properly followed\n- Tests: Manual verification required (documented in checklist files)\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. ✅ **Ready for merge to main** (from code quality perspective)\n2. ⚠️ **Recommend manual E2E testing** before production deployment (see E2E_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)\n3. 📝 **Future improvements**: Add test framework, fix minor linting\n\n---\n\nLet me now update the implementation plan with QA approval:",
