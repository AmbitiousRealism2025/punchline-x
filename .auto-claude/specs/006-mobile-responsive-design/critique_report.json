  "critique_summary": "Spec was well-structured and technically accurate overall. Found and fixed 6 issues: 2 medium-severity completeness gaps (missing files in modification table, incomplete viewport units guidance) and 4 low-severity issues (terminology inconsistency, missing Radix mobile pattern, missing touch event gotcha, breakpoint notation clarity). All issues were cross-referenced against research.json findings and resolved. The spec now has complete file coverage, comprehensive viewport units guidance with fallback patterns, consistent terminology, and includes important mobile-specific patterns from research.",

    "Phase 6 (Testing & Optimization) mentions Lighthouse audits - consider documenting the specific Lighthouse flags/configuration to ensure consistent testing",
    "Implementation Strategy is well-phased - recommend following the order strictly as later phases depend on foundation work in earlier phases"
