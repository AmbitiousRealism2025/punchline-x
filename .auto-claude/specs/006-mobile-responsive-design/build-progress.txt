=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Punchline X - Mobile-Responsive Design
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/006-mobile-responsive-design
Started: 2026-01-06

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Adding new mobile device support capability to existing desktop-optimized application. Requires implementing responsive layouts, touch interactions, and performance optimizations without changing core functionality.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 18
- Created init.sh
- Updated project_index.json with tech stack details
- Updated context.json with files to modify and patterns

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 3 subtasks - Mobile infrastructure setup (viewport, CSS config, code splitting)
- Phase 2 (Layout): 2 subtasks - Shell and App layout mobile optimization, depends on phase-1
- Phase 3 (UI Primitives): 4 subtasks - Touch target optimization for button/toggle/tabs, depends on phase-1
- Phase 4 (Scorer): 4 subtasks - Scorer components mobile optimization, depends on phase-2 and phase-3
- Phase 5 (Templates): 2 subtasks - Templates components mobile optimization, depends on phase-2 and phase-3
- Phase 6 (Integration): 4 subtasks - E2E testing and performance verification, depends on phase-4 and phase-5

Services Involved:
- punchline-x: React 19.2.0 app with Tailwind v4, single service

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  * Group 1: phase-2-layout + phase-3-ui-primitives (both depend only on phase-1, different file sets)
  * Group 2: phase-4-scorer + phase-5-templates (both depend on phase-2 and phase-3, different component sets)
- Speedup estimate: 1.4x faster than sequential execution

Critical Technical Constraints:
- Tailwind v4 uses @theme inline {} in CSS, NOT tailwind.config.js
- All breakpoints must use rem units (not px) to avoid ordering bugs
- Minimum touch target size: 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Mobile-first pattern: base styles for mobile, md:/lg: for desktop
- Add active: states alongside all hover: states for touch feedback
- Code splitting only for bundles >30kb to avoid excessive network requests

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: HIGH (cross-cutting UI change affecting 28+ files)
- Manual testing prioritized: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, viewport tests
- Browser verification required at 375px, 768px, 1920px viewports
- Performance targets: Lighthouse >85, load time <3s on 3G
- Desktop regression testing critical (1920px viewport)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd app && npm run dev

Or to start the auto-build orchestrator:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 006 --parallel 2
