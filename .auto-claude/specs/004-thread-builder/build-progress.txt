=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Punchline X - Thread Builder Feature
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/004-thread-builder
Started: 2026-01-07 (Session 1 - Planning)

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New feature addition extending the single-tweet composition interface. Introduces new UI components (thread editor, drag-and-drop), new state patterns (multi-tweet arrays), and new scoring logic (thread-level aggregate scoring). Builds on existing infrastructure while adding significant new functionality.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 15
- Created init.sh
- Updated project_index.json
- Updated context.json

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Dependencies Setup): 1 subtask, no dependencies
  * Install @dnd-kit packages (core, sortable, utilities)

- Phase 2 (Thread State Management): 2 subtasks, depends on phase-1
  * Add thread state tables to TinyBase store
  * Create helper functions for thread operations

- Phase 3 (Thread UI Components): 4 subtasks, depends on phase-2
  * Create ThreadTweet component (single tweet editor)
  * Create ThreadBuilder component (main composer)
  * Create ThreadScoreDisplay component
  * Create threads component index file

- Phase 4 (Thread Scoring Logic): 3 subtasks, depends on phase-2
  * Create thread flow analysis module
  * Create thread aggregate scoring function
  * Create useThreadScore hook

- Phase 5 (Thread Suggestions): 2 subtasks, depends on phase-4
  * Create thread suggestions generator
  * Create ThreadSuggestions component

- Phase 6 (App Integration): 3 subtasks, depends on phase-3 + phase-5
  * Add Threads tab to App.tsx
  * Implement thread copy-to-clipboard functionality
  * End-to-end thread workflow verification

Services Involved:
- frontend (React 19.2.0 + TypeScript + Vite 7.2.4)
  - Tech: TinyBase state, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, @dnd-kit
  - Port: 5173
  - Path: ./app

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  1. Phases 2 (state) + 4 (scoring): Both depend on phase-1, different files
  2. Phase 3 (components): Depends on phase-2, new component files
  3. Phase 5 (suggestions): Depends on phase-4, different files than phase-3
- Speedup estimate: 1.5x faster than sequential

Critical Patterns to Follow:
- TinyBase State: setRow() to init, useCell() to read, useSetCellCallback() to update
- Component Structure: Radix UI Cards + Tailwind CSS, state in TinyBase not useState
- Scoring System: Modular with separate files, calculateScore() entry point
- Drag-and-Drop: @dnd-kit with DndContext + SortableContext + useSortable()

Files to Modify:
- app/src/App.tsx (add Threads tab)
- app/src/lib/store/index.ts (thread state)
- app/package.json (install @dnd-kit)
- app/src/lib/scoring/calculator.ts (thread scoring)
- app/src/lib/scoring/suggestions.ts (thread suggestions)

Files to Create:
- app/src/components/threads/ThreadTweet.tsx
- app/src/components/threads/ThreadBuilder.tsx
- app/src/components/threads/ThreadScoreDisplay.tsx
- app/src/components/threads/ThreadSuggestions.tsx
- app/src/components/threads/index.ts
- app/src/lib/scoring/flow.ts
- app/src/hooks/useThreadScore.ts

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 004 --parallel 2

OR manually start the dev server:

  cd app && npm run dev

Then navigate to: http://localhost:5173

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: medium
Test Types Required: unit, integration, e2e (manual browser testing)
Security Scanning: NOT required
Staging Deployment: NOT required

Acceptance Criteria:
- Thread composition works with 2-25 tweets
- Individual tweet scoring functional
- Aggregate thread scoring accurate
- Drag-and-drop reordering works (mouse + keyboard)
- Thread suggestions display and update
- Thread state persists to localStorage
- Copy-to-clipboard exports correct format
- No console errors during operation
- Existing single-tweet scorer unaffected

Browser Verification Required:
- http://localhost:5173
- Threads tab appears in navigation
- ThreadBuilder component renders
- Can add tweets up to 25 maximum
- Cannot save with < 2 tweets
- Individual scores display for each tweet
- Aggregate thread score displays
- Drag-and-drop works with mouse
- Keyboard navigation works (arrow keys + spacebar)
- Tweet numbering updates after reorder
- Suggestions panel displays
- Copy button works and formats correctly
- No console errors
- Thread persists after page reload

=== NOTES ===

- No test framework currently configured (manual testing required)
- Single-service React app (no backend, no Docker)
- Uses TinyBase localStorage for persistence
- Must not break existing single-tweet composer functionality
