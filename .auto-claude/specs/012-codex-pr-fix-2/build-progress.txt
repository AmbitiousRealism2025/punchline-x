=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Punchline-X
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/012-codex-pr-fix-2
Started: 2026-01-06 23:00:00

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: Issue #5 contains only Codex bot template without specific code suggestions. Must fetch actual review data from PR #4 (review ID 3633255069) before determining scope. Investigation-first approach ensures we understand the problem before implementing solutions.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 11
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Reproduce): 4 subtasks - Fetch Codex review data from GitHub
- Phase 2 (Investigate): 2 subtasks - Analyze findings and document determination
- Phase 3 (Fix): 3 subtasks - Implement fixes IF actionable issues found (CONDITIONAL)
- Phase 4 (Harden): 2 subtasks - Final verification and issue resolution

Services Involved:
- punchline-x: React 19.2.0 SPA with TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite 7.2.4, Tailwind CSS 4.1.18, ESLint 9

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None - Sequential execution required due to investigation dependencies
- Speedup estimate: N/A (sequential workflow)

Key Investigation Steps:
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (gh auth status)
2. Fetch PR #4 metadata (gh pr view 4 --json reviews,comments,files,commits)
3. Retrieve review ID 3633255069 comments (gh api repos/AmbitiousRealism2025/punchline-x/pulls/4/reviews/3633255069/comments)
4. Analyze commit 563ece1fbd to understand reviewed code
5. Document findings in INVESTIGATION.md
6. Determine: Actionable issues vs Invalid/duplicate
7. IF actionable: Implement Codex suggestions
8. IF invalid: Close issue with documentation

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: Low
- Test Types Required: Unit tests (if code changes made)
- Security Scanning: Not required
- Staging Deployment: Not required
- Browser Verification: Required (http://localhost:5173)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

Session 2 (Implementation):
- Completed Phase 1 (Reproduce and Fetch Review Data): 4/4 subtasks ✓

Subtask 1-1: GitHub CLI Authentication ✓
- Verified authentication with gh auth status
- Logged in to AmbitiousRealism2025 account
- Repository access confirmed for punchline-x

Subtask 1-2: Fetch PR #4 Metadata ✓
- Retrieved PR #4: "Thread Builder - Multi-tweet thread composer with scoring"
- Found Codex review PRR_kwDOQ1DQkM7YjxKd on commit 563ece1fbd
- PR has 17 commits and 49 files changed

Subtask 1-3: Retrieve Codex Review Comments ✓
- Successfully fetched review ID 3633255069 detailed comments
- Found 2 actionable code issues:
  * P1: ThreadBuilder.tsx - Memoization bug preventing re-renders on threadTweets changes
  * P2: calculator.ts - Using local stub instead of text-aware generateThreadSuggestions
- Issue #5 IS actionable - contains legitimate bugs

Subtask 1-4: Analyze Commit 563ece1fbd ✓
- Commit is the final commit in PR #4 (Thread Builder feature)
- Updated build status, QA docs, and template files
- Changed 11 files: build-progress.txt, implementation_plan.json, QA docs, template files
- Codex reviewed entire PR including all 49 files (17 commits)
- Confirmed both P1 and P2 issues exist in the codebase at this commit

Key Findings:
1. PR #4 introduced Thread Builder feature with drag-and-drop, scoring, and suggestions
2. Codex identified 2 legitimate bugs that prevent features from working correctly
3. ThreadBuilder won't re-render when tweets are added/deleted/reordered
4. Thread suggestions won't show text-based insights (hooks, CTAs, climax)

Next Phase: Document investigation findings and update Issue #5

=== END SESSION 2 ===

Session 3 (Implementation):
- Completed Phase 2, Subtask 2-1: Document Investigation Findings ✓

Subtask 2-1: Document investigation findings in INVESTIGATION.md ✓
- Created comprehensive INVESTIGATION.md (281 lines)
- Documented executive summary with ACTIONABLE determination
- Detailed all Phase 1 investigation steps and findings
- Documented both Codex issues with code examples and fixes:
  * P1 (CRITICAL): ThreadBuilder.tsx memoization bug - UI won't update
  * P2 (HIGH): calculator.ts using stub instead of full implementation
- Created files affected table with effort estimates (30 min total)
- Provided clear next steps for Phase 3 implementation
- Included risk assessment (LOW risk), references, and documentation links
- Committed: e2b9424 "auto-claude: subtask-2-1 - Document investigation findings in INVESTIGATION.md"

Next: Update GitHub Issue #5 with investigation summary (Subtask 2-2)
