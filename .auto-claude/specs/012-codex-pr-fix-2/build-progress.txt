=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Punchline-X
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/012-codex-pr-fix-2
Started: 2026-01-06 23:00:00

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: Issue #5 contains only Codex bot template without specific code suggestions. Must fetch actual review data from PR #4 (review ID 3633255069) before determining scope. Investigation-first approach ensures we understand the problem before implementing solutions.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 4
- Total subtasks: 11
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Reproduce): 4 subtasks - Fetch Codex review data from GitHub
- Phase 2 (Investigate): 2 subtasks - Analyze findings and document determination
- Phase 3 (Fix): 3 subtasks - Implement fixes IF actionable issues found (CONDITIONAL)
- Phase 4 (Harden): 2 subtasks - Final verification and issue resolution

Services Involved:
- punchline-x: React 19.2.0 SPA with TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite 7.2.4, Tailwind CSS 4.1.18, ESLint 9

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None - Sequential execution required due to investigation dependencies
- Speedup estimate: N/A (sequential workflow)

Key Investigation Steps:
1. Authenticate GitHub CLI (gh auth status)
2. Fetch PR #4 metadata (gh pr view 4 --json reviews,comments,files,commits)
3. Retrieve review ID 3633255069 comments (gh api repos/AmbitiousRealism2025/punchline-x/pulls/4/reviews/3633255069/comments)
4. Analyze commit 563ece1fbd to understand reviewed code
5. Document findings in INVESTIGATION.md
6. Determine: Actionable issues vs Invalid/duplicate
7. IF actionable: Implement Codex suggestions
8. IF invalid: Close issue with documentation

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: Low
- Test Types Required: Unit tests (if code changes made)
- Security Scanning: Not required
- Staging Deployment: Not required
- Browser Verification: Required (http://localhost:5173)
